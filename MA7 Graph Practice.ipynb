    "#### Graph class\n",
    "Implement an unweighted Graph using an <b>adjacency matrix</b> representation where the vertices are represented as rows and columns of a matrix and the edges are represented by the cells at the intersection of the row and column vertices.\n",
    "\n",
    "As part of the implementation, define a list to store vertices and a 2-dimensional list to store edges. Define methods to add and remove vertices and edges to the graphs, and print the string representation of the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is the list of fields and methods to be defined for the implementation:\n",
    "- `Graph` class:\n",
    "   - Fields: \n",
    "       - `self.vert_list`: list of all the vertices\n",
    "       - `self.adj_matrix`: 2-dimensional Python list respresenting edges between the vertices.<br><br>\n",
    "       \n",
    "   - Methods:\n",
    "       - `__init__(self)`: initializes the vert_list to an empty list, the and adj_matrix to an empty 2-D list.\n",
    "       - `add_vertex(self, key)`: adds a vertex to the vert_list if it does not exist already. If the vertex exists in the vert_list, the list is not modified.\n",
    "       - `add_edge(self, v1, v2)`: adds an edge of weight 1 between vertices v1 and v2, as well as v2 and v1 in the adj_matrix. If either vertex is not present in the vert_list, the vertex is added to the vert_list, and then the edge is added to the adj_matrix.\n",
    "       - `__str__(self)`: retuns a string representation of the graph in the form:<br>\n",
    "       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (v1, v2)<br>\n",
    "       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (v1, v3)<br>\n",

    "       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (vn, vn-1)<br>\n",
    "       The string representation should only show the edges that are present in the graph.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Note</b>: This implementation would be different than the one shown in lecture notes which is based on adjacency list representation. \n",
    "\n",
